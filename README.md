# パズ愛 ❤️

This is a side project for [pazusoba](https://github.com/HenryQuan/pazusoba). The goal is to improve the accuracy and performance of pazusoba with the power of magic.

## Max score in 10 steps

Pazusoba might be stuck in the local maxima because it cannot see in the future. With this, local maxima could be resolved most of the time and thus, improve the accuracy without performance losses. This idea was brought up by Cody senpai and it is an improvement on the algorithm.

## Setup

```console
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
